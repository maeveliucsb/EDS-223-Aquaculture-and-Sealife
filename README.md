This repo reviews aquaculture as an alternative source of food provisions in the United States, with a focus on two economically powerful mollusks as the cases of analysis. This repository relies on information from Sea Life Base, NOAA sea surface temperature data, GEBCO (ocean depth) data, and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) data from Marineregions.org.

If a bug is spotted-shoot me an email (maeveli@ucsb.edu) and we can figure out together what's going on. Include the code ran, the error message recieved, and a screenshot of what you're working with. I'd appreciate it if you didn't contribute to this! Its my work for a class and a record of my process for research.

I will be the sole author and contributor to this homework assignment. The assignment was written by Ruth Oliver.
